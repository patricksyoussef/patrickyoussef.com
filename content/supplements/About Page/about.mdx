# About Me

Hi there! I'm Patrick Youssef.

I'm currently a graduate student pursuing my master's degree in computer science at the University of California San Diego. In the past, I got my BS in mechanical engineering at the University of California Irvine, interned at SpaceX, and pursued other endeavours on my campus and in my community.

This website serves as a place for me to share my work and possibly useful information within the fields of robotics, machine learning, simulation, and other such topics. I would love if you took some time to look around and please let me know if you have any ideas!
