# About Me

Hi there! I'm Patrick Youssef.

I recently graduated with my master's degree in computer science at the University of California San Diego. In the past, I got my BS in mechanical engineering at the University of California Irvine, interned at SpaceX working on flight simulation infrastructure, and pursued other endeavours on my campus and in my community.

This website serves as a place for me to share my work and possibly useful information within the fields of machine learning, simulation, robotics, and other such topics. If you can, take some time to look around and let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions.

I'm currently pursuing full-time software engineering roles in the Bay Area or Remote. My primary expertise is in machine learning and simulation but I am open to all opportunities, reach out if you want to chat more!
