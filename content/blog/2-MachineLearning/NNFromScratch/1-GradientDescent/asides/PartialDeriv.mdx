This is just a short refresher so if you more of a dive in I would recommend looking at the [*Mathematics for Machine Learning*](https://mml-book.github.io/) book, it's one of my favorites!

### Derivatives

In calculus, the derivative of a function measures the sensitivity or slope of the function's result with respect to another variable.

To compute derivatives we use many rules and shorthands that help us. Over time you get an idea of which ones exits pretty naturally but when you're just starting you'll need to have a [table of differentiation](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-rules.html) rules handy.

Let's consider a simple example where we have a real-valued function $f(x)$. To be precise we have a function $f$ that depends on one variable $x$. We can take the derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ (denoted as $df/dx$ or $f'(x)$) to see how sensitive the output of $f$ is to changes in $x$.

$$
f(x) = x^2 + 1
$$

$$
\frac{df}{dx} = 2x
$$

Given the derivative we can see that the sensitivity of the change depends on the value of $x$ and we could evaluate it if we wanted to. I got the derivative using something called the power rule which can be found in the aforementioned table.

### Partial Derivatives

For all intensive purposes, the process of determining partial derivatives is the same as for normal derivatives with some small tweaks. The most important of which is how we treat a function of multiple variables and how we differentiate.

Let's consider another function $f$ except this time it's $f(x, y)$ which means it depends on multiple variables. Considering this, we can take two different derivatives, one with respect to each of input variables which are called *partial derivatives*. To compute these derivatives we hold all other variables as constants when integrating with respect to one.

$$
f(x, y) = 2xy + x + y
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2y + 1 + 0
\quad
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2x + 0 + 1
$$

As with the typical derivative, these tell us how sensitive $f$ is to changes in $x$ and $y$ but now these might actually be functions of multiple variables. We use the same differentiation rules to get these except when evaluating $\partial f / \partial x$ we treat $y$ and all other variables as if they are constant and vice versa for other variables.
