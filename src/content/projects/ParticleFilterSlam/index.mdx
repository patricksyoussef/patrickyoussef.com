# Introduction

In this post we will discuss an approach to solving the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem for a mobile vehicle and attempt to understand the shortcomings of the given implementation.

# Report

As this was part of my graduate studies I cannot publish the code but the below button will take you to the formal writeup associated with the project. Also the report has _much_ more detail than this post will so I highly advice you look through it for more information, here I will be focusing on high level principles and results.

# Technical Approach

Here I will discuss how I implemented a particle filter for solving the SLAM problem.
