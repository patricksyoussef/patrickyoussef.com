### Code

Just to play around with proposed changes! Wow the metastring usage is so much nicer! 

```python output=6 highlight=1,4-6
# Create an instance of our logistic regression class
MyModel = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model on the training set using a learning rate of 0.1
# and 300 iterations
MyModel.train(X_train, y_train, 0.1, 300)

# Prep test data and get predictions for y_test
X_test = MyModel.prep_data(X_test)
X_test = MyModel.add_dimension(X_test)
y_test_est = MyModel.predict(X_test)

Training Accuracy on Iteration 50: 0.8894
Training Accuracy on Iteration 100: 0.9196
Training Accuracy on Iteration 150: 0.9221
Training Accuracy on Iteration 200: 0.9271
Training Accuracy on Iteration 250: 0.9271
Training Accuracy on Iteration 300: 0.9271
```
