# Introduction

### Code

Just to play around with proposed changes!

Wow the metastring usage is so much nicer!

```python highlight={1,2-4} output=3
print("This should render as a python code block!")
```

`and this is inline`

### Table Example

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

### Tasklist

* [ ] to do
* [x] done

### Footnotes!
