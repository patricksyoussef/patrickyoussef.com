# Neural Net Series

In this series, I hope to build intuition and understanding of machine learning topics leading up to modern neural networks, below is the plan for the series and links to completed posts.

- [Gradient Descent](/blog/neural-net-gradient-descent/)
- Logistic Regression for Classification
- Two Layer Neural Network
- Gradients Over Many Layers
- Modern Deep Learning Frameworks
