## Motivation For Site

My motivations for the site are as follows:

- I enjoy teaching and sharing information so I recently decided I wanted to increase the audience I could reach.
- As I progress through my career I find that I am building a mix of materials that represent me, a website serves to host all of these materials in a cohesive nature.
