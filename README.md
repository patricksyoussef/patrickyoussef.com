## Motivation For Site

My motivations for the site are as follows:

- I enjoy teaching and sharing information so I recently decided I wanted to increase the audience I could reach.
- As I progress through my career I find that I am building a mix of materials that represent me, a website serves to host all of these materials in a cohesive nature.

## Site Framework

### Requirements

After much research, the static site generator Gatsby seemed like a perfect fit. I'll go over my requirements and how Gatsby satisfied them.

1. Fast Loading and Light
   - Gatsby by nature is a static site generator which means the served file are server generated and so little to no processing is needed on the client end.
   - This makes it perfect for mobile with bandwidth and processing limits applied.
2. Low Post Overhead
   - As Gatsby server generates, there are some plugins that take advantage of this to have a Markdown parser.
   - On page generation, Gatsby will load in all the markdown files that can be passed into a blog post template, therefore all I need to do is write markdown files!
3. Programmatic
   - Gatsby is built on ReactJS which is by nature exactly what I wanted for this!

## Next Steps

I am actively working on the site but here are some of the major points I am working to tackle.

- Write more posts
  - I have a backlog of ideas and partially written posts that I need to get ready to be shared
  - Topics on the table write now include but are not limited to:
    - Neural Nets from Scratch
    - Numerical Integrators
    - Dimensionality Reduction
- Create project summaries with some more visualizations
  - These would be summaries that would point to GitHub repos
